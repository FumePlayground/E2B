# Project Name Change Notice

## Introduction
We are excited to announce that the E2B project will henceforth be known as E3B. This change will reflect our evolving mission and expanding capabilities.

## Reason for the Change
The name E3B better aligns with our strategic directions and growth. It encapsulates our commitment to enhancement and excellence in bridging enterprises with their business needs.

## Implications
- All references to the old name (E2B) in the documentation, codebase, and communications should be updated to E3B.
- This change will be progressively implemented across all our platforms and materials.
